# Sparkle Updates Configuration in Xcode

This document describes how to configure the Sparkle auto-update system in a GitHub repository containing an Xcode project. I assume that the Sparkle package and the logic for checking for updates have already been added to the Xcode project, and that what remains to be configured is the way to upload a release to GitHub so that the user can know if he has the latest version of the app.

## Nomenclature

- `Xcodeproject` -> Xcode project name
- `Xcodeproject_app` -> Xcode product name
- `GitHub_user` -> GitHub repo owner
- `GitHub_repo` -> GitHub repo name

## Generate keys

- Get a Sparkle distribution from the [releases](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases) page
- Run `./generate_keys` (available in the `bin` folder in the Sparkle distribution root, this needs to be done only once):
	- it generates a private key that's saved in the login Keychain of the Mac 
	- it prints a public key to be embedded into the apps; write this key down for later use in the Xcode Info.plist file
	- run `./generate_keys` each time you need to see the public key again.

## Configuration

### Info.plist Settings

Add the following keys in `Xcodeproject-Info.plist` to configure Sparkle:

- SUFeedURL: Points to the appcast XML file
  - Current value: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitHub_user/GitHub_repo/main/appcast.xml`
  - Note: this link must point to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com`, not to `https://github.com`
- SUPublicEDKey: Public EdDSA key (previously noted) for verifying update signatures

```xml
	<key>SUFeedURL</key>
	<string>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitHub_user/GitHub_repo/main/appcast.xml</string>
	<key>SUPublicEDKey</key>
	<string>TYAEerTXwSU8wHwYzot2VEzwcPNeKLNQaTVSHkXV3vI=</string>
```

### Appcast File

The `appcast.xml` file follows the Sparkle RSS-based format:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:sparkle="http://www.andymatuschak.org/xml-namespaces/sparkle" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">

#### appcast.xml components:

- link: repository web address
- language: predefined language
- item: to set more than one release
- title: you can set the version number
- description empty: Sparkle displays a smaller update dialog, without version notes
- description with HTML text between CDATA tags: Sparkle displays a larger update dialog where we can see the release notes
- enclosure: version-specific data
	- url -> link to the app ZIP file
	- sparkle:version -> build number (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` = `CFBundleVersion`)
	- sparkle:shortVersionString-> human readable app version (`MARKETING_VERSION`)
	- length -> app ZIP file in bytes
	- sparkle:edSignature -> public EdDSA key for verifying update signatures
	- type -> "application/octet-stream"
	- minimumSystemVersion -> min. version of Xcode target

#### appcast.xml localization

It is copied to the root of the repository.

## Publishing a New Release

When publishing a new release, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Application**
   
   - Build the app in Xcode using Release configuration
   - Save the application

2. **Create a ZIP File**
   
   - Compress the `.app` bundle `Xcodeproject_app`
   - Note the file size in bytes: `ls -l Xcodeproject_app.zip`.

3. **Sign the Update (Required for Security)**
   
   - Sparkle requires EdDSA signatures to verify update authenticity
   - Compress as ZIP the Xcode product intended to be uploaded as release to GitHub (e.g. Xcodeproject.zip)
   - Run `./sign_update Xcodeproject_app.zip` (`sign_update` is available in the `bin` folder in the Sparkle distribution root)
   - You get 2 data, write down for later use:
      - sparkle:edSignature -> a base64-encoded string to be added into the appcast.xml file
      - length -> ZIP file size in bytes.  

4. **Create GitHub Release**
   
   - Create a new release on GitHub with the version tag (e.g., `1.0.1`)
   - Upload the `Xcodeproject_app.zip` file as a release asset
   - Add release notes describing the changes In relase page and in appcast.xml).

5. **Update appcast.xml**
   
   - Add a new `<item>` below `<language>` section
   - Update the version number, date, and download URL
   - Update the `length` attribute with the ZIP file size in bytes
   - Add the EdDSA signature to the `<enclosure>` tag.

6. **Commit and Push**
  
   - Commit the updated `appcast.xml` file
   - Push to the main branch
   - The app will now check for updates and find the new version.

### Testing with disabled signature verification (for development)

For testing purposes only, you can temporarily disable signature verification by removing the `SUPublicDSAKeyFile` key from `Xcodeproject-Info.plist`. However, this is **not recommended** for production releases as it allows anyone to publish fake updates.

To test updates without EdDSA signature verification:

1. **Remove SUPublicEDKey from Info.plist** (if present):
  
   - Remove the `<key>SUPublicEDKey</key>` line and its corresponding `<string>...</string>` value
   - Or comment it out for easy restoration later.

2. **Ensure SUFeedURL uses raw.githubusercontent.com**:
  
   - Correct: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitHub_user/GitHub_repo/main/appcast.xml`
   - Wrong: `https://github.com/GitHub_user/GitHub_repo/blob/main/appcast.xml`
   - The blob URL returns HTML, not XML, causing parsing errors.

3. **Remove EdDSA signature from appcast.xml** (if present):
   
   - The `sparkle:edSignature` attribute in the `<enclosure>` tag can be omitted when signature verification is disabled.

4. **Test the configuration**:
   
   - Build and run the app in Xcode
   - Select `Xcodeproject_app` > `Check for Updates...`
   - The app should fetch and parse the feed successfully (though it may not show an update if versions match).

**Important**: Remember to re-enable signature verification before releasing to production by adding back the `SUPublicEDKey` key and including EdDSA signatures in the appcast.

### Testing with local file (for development)

1. **Get the full path to your appcast.xml:**
   
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/GitHub_repo
   pwd
   # Copy the output, e.g., /Users/me/GitHub_repo
   ```

2. **Temporarily edit Info.plist:**
   
   ```xml
   <key>SUFeedURL</key>
   <string>file:///Users/me/GitHub_repo/appcast.xml</string>
   ```

3. **Build and test:**
   
   - Open Xcodeproject.xcodeproj in Xcode
   - Build (⌘B)
   - Run (⌘R)
   - Select `Xcodeproject_app` > `Check for Updates...`

4. **Expected result:**
   
   - You'll see a security warning (expected with file://) about "Auto-update not configured"
   - Click OK
   - You should then see either:
     - "You're up-to-date!" (if build version matches appcast)
     - "A new version is available" (if appcast version is higher)
     - "Update error" with signature verification failure (if signature is invalid).

5. **Remember to revert SUFeedURL** before committing.

## Important Notes

- Multiple versions can be listed in the appcast file (newest first)
- Sparkle will automatically determine if an update is available
- The version comparison uses semantic versioning

## Troubleshooting

### "Update error!" Dialog

If users see "An error occurred in retrieving update information", check:

1. The `appcast.xml` file is accessible at the URL specified in `SUFeedURL`
   - Common mistake: Using `https://github.com/.../blob/main/appcast.xml` instead of `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/appcast.xml`
   - The blob URL returns HTML (which causes "crossorigin attribute" errors), not the raw XML content
   - Always use the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for the feed
2. The XML is well-formed (no syntax errors)
3. The download URL in the `<enclosure>` tag is valid and accessible
4. The release asset exists on GitHub.

### EdDSA Signature Verification Failures

If signature verification fails:

1. Ensure the `SUPublicEDKey` value in Info.plist matches the public key from your key pair
2. Check that the `sparkle:edSignature` in the appcast matches the ZIP file signature
3. Verify you're using the correct attribute name: `sparkle:edSignature` (not `sparkle:dsaSignature`)
4. Make sure the signature was generated with the matching private key
5. Consider disabling signature verification during testing (not recommended for production).

### "An error occurred while extracting the archive" Dialog

If users see this error after clicking "Install and Relaunch", there are two common causes:

**Cause 1 — Ad-hoc code signing:** `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"` in Xcode build settings. Sparkle 1.x checks that the update bundle's code-signing identity matches the running app. With ad-hoc signing every build gets a unique cdhash, so the check always fails between different builds.

**Cause 2 — Hardened Runtime on nested Sparkle tools:** Using `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS = "--deep"` together with `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES` causes Xcode to re-sign `Autoupdate.app` and `fileop` (the tools inside `Sparkle.framework` that perform the actual installation) with Hardened Runtime restrictions. These tools were never designed to run under Hardened Runtime and will fail to perform the file operations needed to complete the update.

**Fix:**

1. In Xcode build settings for the Release configuration, do **not** override `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` with `"-"`. Leave it unset so that `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic` can select your Apple Developer certificate.
2. Do **not** set `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS = "--deep"`. Without `--deep`, `CodeSignOnCopy` re-signs only the top-level `Sparkle.framework` library with your developer certificate, leaving `Autoupdate.app` and `fileop` with their original Sparkle-distributed signatures and entitlements intact.
3. Rebuild the Release app, re-create the ZIP, re-sign it with `sign_update`, and update the appcast.
